## Split-Test Analysis

Here is a table of the data I was provided, along with the percentage response (Views/Quotes) for each quote request variaton.

|Bucket     |Quotes|Views|Response|
|:----------|:----:|:---:|:-------|
|Baseline   |32    |595  |5.378151|
|Variation 1|30    |599  |5.008347|
|Variation 2|18    |622  |2.893891|
|Variation 3|51    |606  |8.415842|
|Variation 4|38    |578  |6.574394|


In your project description you stated that you divided invites from about 3000 quote requests.  There are 3000 views in total.  It is not clear whether 3000 requests were sent out and all of them were viewed, or if more were sent out, and of those, 3000 were viewed.  Your requests drew an average of 600 views with an average response rate of 5.6%.


### Impressions
Your data raise a few questions:
  * How many of each invite variation were sent out? It might be significant that more of Variation 2 were viewed even though it resulted in fewer quotes, and that Variation 4 received the fewest views but had a relatively high response rate.

  * What is most important to you now:  maximizing views, or quotes?

  * How did you determine who to send each variation to? It might be that certain types of businesses/people respond better to one variation or another.


Variation 3 has the best response rate by a small margin, and Variation 2 illicited the fewest responses, even with a slightly larger sample size.
Response to Variation 1 does not differ much from of that the baseline request form.

Assuming that the sample was random (each type of recipient was selected was selected with equal probability), and that an equal number of each variation was sent out:
It appears that your best bet is to use variation 3, or continue to develop the improvements in that version.

I would be curious to know how many of each variation were sent out, and which classes and categories were represented in the responses.  For example, how many people from each location viewed Variation 2? How many of each job category illicited a quote from each of the request variations? I would like to see the views and quotes numbers divided into classifications because it might be that efficacy of quote request depends on location or job category.  We might find that each variation has a niche, suggesting several targeted request forms.
